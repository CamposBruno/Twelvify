# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Project:** Twelvify (AI-powered text simplification Chrome extension)
**Milestone:** v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** GAPS FOUND — Phase 3 not started (8 unsatisfied requirements)

---

## Executive Summary

Phases 1 and 2 are **fully verified and integrated**. All 15 requirements assigned to these phases are satisfied with working implementations, verified by both automated checks and human UAT. Cross-phase integration is 100% — all exports consumed, all E2E flows complete, zero orphaned code.

**However**, Phase 3 (Personalization & UX Polish) has not been started. Its 8 requirements (SIMP-03, SIMP-04, DISP-01, DISP-02, PERS-01 through PERS-04) have no plans, no implementations, and no verifications. This forces a `gaps_found` status on the milestone.

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Text Selection (6/6 satisfied)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|--------------|--------|

| ERRH-04 | Text too long error with guidance | passed | provides | `[x]` | **satisfied** |

### Phase 3: Personalization & UX Polish (0/8 — NOT STARTED)

| REQ-ID | Description | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| SIMP-03 | Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S) | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| SIMP-04 | Revert text to original with one click | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| DISP-01 | Simplified text replaces original in-page | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| DISP-02 | Floating popup display mode option | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |

| PERS-03 | Profession/interests for relatable analogies | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| PERS-04 | Preferences persist via chrome.storage.sync | missing | missing | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Verification Date |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation & Text Selection | PASSED | 16/16 must-haves | 2026-02-23 |
| Phase 2: Backend Integration & AI Simplification | PASSED | 28/28 must-haves | 2026-02-24 |
| Phase 3: Personalization & UX Polish | NOT STARTED | — | — |

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Status: FULLY INTEGRATED (Phases 1-2)**

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Exports consumed | 9/9 (100%) |
| E2E flows verified | 5/5 (100%) |
| Orphaned code | 0 |
| Missing connections | 0 |

### Verified E2E Flows

1. **Text Selection → Button Appears** — Content script → sendMessage → background → storage → FloatingButton
2. **Click → Loading Spinner** — onClick → handleSimplify → SET_LOADING → storage → spinner UI
3. **SSE Streaming → DOM Update** — fetch → ReadableStream → SSE parse → textNode.textContent
4. **Error → Error Display** — error detected → SIMPLIFY_ERROR → storage → yellow button + shake + tooltip
5. **Rate Limit → Reset Time** — 429 response → extract resetAt → minutesLeft → tooltip message

### Integration Notes (Low Severity)

- Backend URL hardcoded to localhost:3001 (development convenience)
- Host permissions include both localhost and production Render domain
- CORS set to wildcard (necessary for content script origin)
- GET /health unused (monitoring-ready)

---

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation & Text Selection
- No remaining tech debt (handleSimplify stub replaced in Phase 2)

### Phase 2: Backend Integration & AI Simplification
- Backend URL hardcoded to localhost:3001 (update before Web Store submission)
- Host permissions include both localhost and production domain (remove localhost before production)
- CORS origin set to wildcard (*) (content scripts send page origin, not extension origin)
- GET /health endpoint unused (available for future monitoring)

**Total: 4 items across 1 phase (all low severity, none blocking)**

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Phase 1: No blockers or stubs remaining after gap closure
- Phase 2: No TODOs, stubs, or placeholders detected — all implementations substantive

---

## Conclusion

**Phases 1-2 are complete and fully integrated.** The extension has a solid foundation (MV3, service worker, storage-driven UI) and a working AI backend integration (SSE streaming, rate limiting, privacy logging, error handling). Human UAT has verified end-to-end functionality.

**Phase 3 is the blocker.** All 8 unsatisfied requirements belong to Phase 3 (Personalization & UX Polish), which has not been started. The milestone cannot be marked as `passed` until Phase 3 is planned, executed, and verified.
