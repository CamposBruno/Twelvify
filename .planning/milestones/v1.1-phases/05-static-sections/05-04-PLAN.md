<objective>
Wire all section components into App.tsx and enable smooth scroll navigation. Then verify the full page visually.

Purpose: This is the integration plan — all components built in parallel in plans 02 and 03 get assembled here. Smooth scroll and the visual verification checkpoint are included.
Output: Complete, navigable landing page with all sections visible and smooth-scroll working.

  <name>Task 1: Wire all sections into App.tsx and enable smooth scroll</name>
  <files>
    landing/src/App.tsx

  </files>
  <action>
    Update `landing/src/App.tsx` to import and render all section components in the correct page order:

    ```tsx
    import Nav from './components/Nav'
    import Hero from './components/Hero'
    import HowItWorks from './components/HowItWorks'
    import Features from './components/Features'
    import CallToAction from './components/CallToAction'
    import Footer from './components/Footer'

    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <Nav />
          <main>
            <Hero />
            <HowItWorks />
            {/* Playground section placeholder — implemented in Phase 6 */}
            <section id="try-it" className="py-32 bg-slate-100">
              <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 text-center">
                <p className="font-punk text-slate-400 text-lg">Playground coming soon — Phase 6</p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <Features />
            <CallToAction />
          </main>
          <Footer />
        </>
      )
    }

    export default App
    ```

    Note on section order: Nav → Hero → HowItWorks → [Playground placeholder with id="try-it"] → Features → CallToAction → Footer. This matches code.html document order. The playground placeholder is needed so nav's "#try-it" anchor works and doesn't produce a dead link.

    Update `landing/src/index.css` — add smooth scroll to the existing @layer base:
    - Add to the beginning of @layer base (before h1/h2/h3 rule):
      ```css
      html {
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
      }
      ```
    This implements INTX-02: smooth scroll navigation for anchor links. No JS scroll handling needed — CSS scroll-behavior: smooth is sufficient and works with all anchor href="#id" links.

    Run `npm run build` to confirm the wiring compiles cleanly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `cd /Users/brunocampos/Twelvify/landing && npm run build` — must exit 0 with no TypeScript errors.
    Check App.tsx imports: `grep "import.*from.*components" landing/src/App.tsx` — should show Hero, HowItWorks, Features, CallToAction, Footer.
    Check smooth scroll: `grep "scroll-behavior" landing/src/index.css`
    Check playground placeholder: `grep 'id="try-it"' landing/src/App.tsx`
  </verify>
  <done>All five sections and Footer mounted in App.tsx in correct order. Playground placeholder with id="try-it" in place. scroll-behavior: smooth in index.css. npm run build exits 0.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of full landing page</name>
  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 5 landing page:
    - Sticky nav with logo, section links (desktop), and ADD TO CHROME button
    - Hero section with badge, headline, CTAs, social proof, CSS browser mockup
    - How-it-works with 3 rotating zine-box cards
    - Playground placeholder section
    - Features with 3 feature items and rotating icon boxes
    - CTA section with paper-tear clip, red background, install buttons
    - Footer with logo, link columns, social links
    - Smooth scroll navigation from nav links to section anchors
    - All hover effects from code.html
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `cd /Users/brunocampos/Twelvify/landing && npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173

    LAYOUT checks:
    2. Verify sticky nav: scroll down — nav stays fixed at top with 4px black bottom border
    3. Resize to mobile width (< 768px): section links (HOW IT WORKS, FEATURES, PLAYGROUND) should disappear — only logo and ADD TO CHROME button visible

    NAVIGATION:
    4. Click "HOW IT WORKS" in nav — page should smooth-scroll to the How-it-works section (not jump)
    5. Click "FEATURES" in nav — smooth scrolls to Features section
    6. Click "PLAYGROUND" — smooth scrolls to the placeholder section

    SECTIONS — visual correctness:
    7. Hero: badge "NOW IN THE WEB STORE (DUH)" in yellow, rotated headline, Install/View Demo buttons, colored-circle avatars, CSS browser mockup (desktop only)
    8. How-it-works: 3 cards with rotation transforms. Hover a card — it should rotate to 0deg smoothly
    9. Features: 3 feature rows with icon boxes. Hover a row — icon box rotates to 0deg smoothly
    10. CTA: red background with paper-tear clip-path bottom edge, "Free to use — Forever" badge, ADD TO CHROME button
    11. Footer: dark background, bike icon logo, three link columns, Twitter/GitHub/Discord links at bottom

    HOVER EFFECTS:
    12. Nav links: hover should fill background with primary red (#f56060) and turn text white
    13. Hero buttons: hover should translate right+down and lose shadow (press effect)
    14. How-it-works cards: hover:rotate-0 (rotation resets to flat)
    15. Feature icon boxes: hover:rotate-0 via parent group hover

    Describe any visual issues or confirm everything looks correct.
  </how-to-verify>
  <action>Run `cd /Users/brunocampos/Twelvify/landing && npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173. Follow the verification steps in how-to-verify above, checking each section, navigation, and hover effect.</action>
  <verify>All 15 items in how-to-verify pass: sticky nav, mobile responsiveness, smooth scroll to all three anchors, correct rendering of all 6 sections, and all hover effects work correctly.</verify>
  <done>Human confirms "approved" — full page renders correctly with all sections, smooth scroll navigation, and hover effects matching the design.</done>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the page looks correct, or describe specific issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

<success_criteria>
- Complete landing page renders top-to-bottom with all sections
- Nav smooth-scrolls to each section anchor on click
- All hover effects from code.html work (rotation resets, shadow press, bg-fill transitions)
- Page is responsive: mobile nav collapses to logo+CTA only, hero mockup hides on mobile
- Human approval obtained via checkpoint
