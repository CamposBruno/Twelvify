# Session State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

## Position

**Milestone:** v1.0 milestone
**Current phase:** 01-foundation-text-selection
**Current Plan:** 2 / 3 (in phase)
**Status:** In Progress

## Decisions

- Used srcDir: 'src' in wxt.config.ts so WXT resolves entrypoints at src/entrypoints/ (WXT default is root/entrypoints)
- npm create wxt@latest unavailable — scaffolded project manually with identical structure to react-ts template
- Manifest config co-located in wxt.config.ts (no separate public/manifest.json needed — WXT merges at build time)
- Only 'storage' permission granted — principle of least privilege per EXTF-04
- [Phase 01-foundation-text-selection]: Used srcDir: src in wxt.config.ts so WXT resolves entrypoints at src/entrypoints
