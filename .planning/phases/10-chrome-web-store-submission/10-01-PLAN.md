<objective>
Add a privacy policy page at twelvify.com/privacy as a second Vite entry point on the existing landing site.

Purpose: Chrome Web Store requires a live privacy policy URL before extension submission. Twelvify handles user-provided text (selected text sent to AI service), which qualifies as sensitive data under Chrome's policies — a privacy policy is mandatory.

Output: A fully rendered privacy policy page at /privacy, reachable from the landing site footer, with accurate data practice disclosures matching actual extension behavior.

  <name>Task 1: Add privacy policy page as Vite multi-page entry</name>

  <action>
Create a second Vite entry point for the privacy page. The landing site has no router (react-dom only, no react-router), so use Vite's multi-page app (MPA) build approach.

**Step 1 — Create `landing/privacy.html`:**
Copy the structure of `landing/index.html` exactly (same font preload, Plausible analytics, Tailwind via vite module, meta tags), but:
- Change `<title>` to "Twelvify | Privacy Policy"
- Change meta description to "Twelvify's privacy policy — how we handle your data."
- Change canonical URL to `https://twelvify.com/privacy`
- Change the script src to `/src/privacy-main.tsx`
- Remove OG/Twitter image meta tags (not needed for legal page)

**Step 2 — Create `landing/src/privacy-main.tsx`:**
```tsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import Privacy from './privacy'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <Privacy />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

**Step 3 — Create `landing/src/privacy.tsx`:**
Full privacy policy page component. Use the landing site's brand styling (Tailwind + brand tokens from tailwind.config.ts):
- `font-display` (Permanent Marker) for headings
- `font-punk` (Special Elite) for body text
- `text-primary` (#f56060) for section headings
- `bg-background-light` for page background
- `border-4 border-slate-900` for section card borders
- Sharp corners throughout (no rounded classes — border-radius is 0 in tailwind config)

Page structure:
```
<main className="bg-background-light min-h-screen py-24 px-6">
  <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-12">
    <header>
      <a href="/" className="font-punk text-primary underline">← Back to Twelvify</a>
      <h1 className="font-display text-6xl text-slate-900 mt-8">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p className="font-punk text-slate-600">Last updated: February 2026</p>
    </header>

    Section cards (border-4 border-slate-900, p-8, space-y-4):
    1. Overview
    2. Data We Collect
    3. How We Use Your Data
    4. What We Don't Do
    5. Data Security
    6. Your Rights
    7. Contact
  </div>
</main>
```

**Privacy policy content to include (exact disclosures required):**

Section 1 — Overview:
> Twelvify is a browser extension that simplifies complex text using AI. When you highlight text on a webpage and click the Twelvify icon, we temporarily send that text to a third-party AI service for processing. The result — a simplified version of your text — is returned to you. We do not store, log, or retain your selected text at any point.

Section 2 — Data We Collect:
- **Your selected text:** Temporarily transmitted to our server and forwarded to a third-party AI service for processing. Not stored after the request completes.
- **Anonymous usage statistics:** We count the number of simplification requests (no user identity, no text content). Statistics are anonymous and aggregated.
- **Server logs:** Standard HTTP request logs (IP address, timestamp, request method) retained for security monitoring and debugging. These are standard server logs, not content logs.

Section 3 — How We Use Your Data:
- To generate simplified text via a third-party AI service
- To monitor server health and diagnose issues
- To understand usage patterns in aggregate (no individual tracking)

Section 4 — What We Don't Do (use `font-punk font-bold` formatting):
- We do NOT log or store your selected text
- We do NOT track your identity, browsing history, or behavior across sites
- We do NOT sell your data to advertisers or third parties
- We do NOT use your text to train AI models
- We do NOT create user profiles or persistent records

Section 5 — Data Security:
> All data transmitted between Twelvify and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS. Your selected text is processed transiently — it is not written to any database or persistent storage. Server logs are retained for a maximum of 30 days for security purposes.

Section 6 — Your Rights:
> Twelvify does not maintain user accounts or persistent user data. There is no profile to delete. If you have questions about data handling or want to request information, contact us at the address below.

Section 7 — Contact:
> Questions about this privacy policy? Email: privacy@twelvify.com

**Step 4 — Update `landing/vite.config.ts`:**
Add `rollupOptions.input` to support multi-page build:
```ts
import { resolve } from 'path'
// In defineConfig:
build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      main: resolve(__dirname, 'index.html'),
      privacy: resolve(__dirname, 'privacy.html'),
    },
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
      },
    },
  },
},
```
Import `resolve` from `path` at top of the file.
  </action>
  <verify>
    cd landing && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
    # Expect: Build completes successfully, no errors
    # Expect: dist/privacy.html exists in build output
    ls dist/privacy.html
  </verify>
  <done>
    `npm run build` in landing/ completes without errors. `dist/privacy.html` exists. The privacy page component includes all 7 required sections with the exact disclosures (no content logging, transient processing, anonymous stats only, "third-party AI service" language).
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Vercel routing for /privacy and update Footer link</name>
  <files>
    landing/vercel.json
    landing/src/components/Footer.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Step 1 — Update `landing/vercel.json`:**
Add a rewrite rule so `/privacy` serves `privacy.html`. Insert after the existing `redirects` array and before `headers`:

```json
"rewrites": [
  {
    "source": "/privacy",
    "destination": "/privacy.html"
  }
]
```

The existing `redirects` array (www → non-www) stays unchanged. The existing `headers` array stays unchanged.

**Step 2 — Update `landing/src/components/Footer.tsx`:**
Find the Legal section in the footer. Update the Privacy anchor from `href="#"` to `href="/privacy"`:
```tsx
<li><a className="hover:text-primary transition-colors hover:underline" href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li>
```
Leave Terms and Security as `href="#"` (those pages don't exist yet — not in scope).
  </action>
  <verify>
    cd landing && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5
    # Build still passes after vercel.json and footer changes
    grep -r "privacy" landing/dist/index.html | head -5
    # Expect: footer link to /privacy appears in built index.html
    cat landing/vercel.json | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "valid JSON"
  </verify>
  <done>
    `landing/vercel.json` is valid JSON with a rewrites rule for `/privacy` → `/privacy.html`. Footer Privacy link has `href="/privacy"`. Build still passes. Deploying to Vercel will serve the privacy page at twelvify.com/privacy.
  </done>
</task>
