<objective>
Create the Chrome Web Store listing copy and 5 screenshot source files. The listing copy covers title, summary, and description. Screenshots are self-contained HTML/CSS files at 1280x800px that simulate realistic UI mockups of the extension in use — rendered to PNGs via a Playwright capture script.

Purpose: Store listing metadata is required for submission. Screenshots are the primary visual signal that persuades users to install. Using HTML mockups instead of live browser captures allows Claude to produce accurate, annotated, 1280x800 screenshots autonomously without needing a running extension or browser.

Output: `store/listing.md` with copy ready to paste into Chrome Developer Dashboard. 5 annotated HTML mockup files + a Playwright script to render them to PNGs.

# Twelvify — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Title (≤75 characters)

Twelvify — Big words, simplified. AI text simplifier.

_Character count: 54 — WITHIN LIMIT_

## Summary (≤132 characters, shown on Extensions management page and Web Store)

## Notes for Developer Dashboard

- Single purpose: Simplify selected text on any webpage using AI
- Permissions justification:
  - `storage`: Saves user reading level preference locally (no server sync)
  - `host_permissions: https://twelvify-backend.onrender.com/*`: Required for content script to call the simplification API
```

Character count validation:
- Title: "Twelvify — Big words, simplified. AI text simplifier." = 54 chars ✓ (under 75)
- Summary: "Highlight any confusing text, click the wand — AI rewrites it in plain English. Instantly." = 91 chars ✓ (under 132)
  </action>
  <verify>
    cat store/listing.md | head -20

  </verify>
  <done>
    `store/listing.md` exists with title (≤75 chars), summary (≤132 chars), and full description. Title leads with "Big words, simplified" messaging. Copy uses casual/friendly tone. AI prominently mentioned. Character counts confirmed within limits.

Create 5 self-contained HTML files that simulate the extension UI at 1280x800px. Each is a realistic-looking browser mockup with the Twelvify extension overlaid. Include text annotations/callouts. Light mode only.

Design system (inline in each HTML, no external dependencies except Google Fonts via CDN):
- Brand primary: #f56060
- Font display: Permanent Marker (Google Fonts CDN)
- Font punk: Special Elite (Google Fonts CDN)
- Font body: Inter (Google Fonts CDN)
- Sharp corners (0px border-radius) for extension UI elements
- Light background: #f8f6f6

**Screenshot 1: Core Flow (screenshot-1-core-flow.html)**

URL bar: `en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis`
Website content: Wikipedia article header + 2 paragraphs of complex text (fabricate plausible text). One sentence has yellow highlight showing selected text.
Floating button: Visible near the selected text.
Popup: Open, showing simplified result.

Content:
- Original: "Photosynthesis is a biological process used by photoautotrophs to convert light energy, normally from the sun, into chemical energy that can be stored and later released to fuel the organism's activities."
- Simplified: "Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to make their own food. They turn light into energy they can store and use later."

Annotations (3):
- ① "Highlight confusing text" (arrow pointing to yellow selected text)
- ② "Click the wand" (arrow pointing to floating button)
- ③ "Get a plain-English version instantly" (arrow pointing to popup result)

---

**Screenshot 2: Settings (screenshot-2-settings.html)**

URL bar: `chrome-extension://[id]/popup.html` (or just show "Twelvify Settings")
Instead of website mockup, show the Twelvify popup in settings mode (full popup panel, not floating).
Show the popup with reading level selector: Beginner / Standard / Advanced (Standard selected with #f56060 highlight).
Show the reading level options as styled buttons with sharp corners.

Annotations (2):
- ① "Set your reading level — Twelvify adjusts simplification to match"
- ② "Your preference is saved locally, no account needed"

---

**Screenshot 3: News Context (screenshot-3-news-context.html)**

URL bar: `nytimes.com/2026/02/economics-policy`
Website content: News article mockup. Bold headline + 2 paragraphs of economic jargon. Text selection active on a complex phrase.
Popup showing simplification result.

Content:
- Original: "The Federal Reserve's quantitative tightening measures have precipitated a contraction in liquidity, exacerbating inflationary pressures amid supply chain disruptions."
- Simplified: "The Federal Reserve is pulling money out of the economy to fight inflation, but this is making things harder while supply chains are still struggling."

Annotations (2):
- ① "Works on any news site — even the jargon-heavy stuff"
- ② "Streaming results appear word by word, no waiting"

---

**Screenshot 4: Before/After Comparison (screenshot-4-before-after.html)**

URL bar: `twelvify.com` (show on landing page for brand consistency)
Split-panel layout showing side-by-side comparison:
- LEFT panel (red border header "BEFORE"): Complex academic text block
- RIGHT panel (green border header "AFTER"): Simplified version
Use large readable font to show the transformation clearly.

Content:
- Before: "The utilization of multisyllabic lexemes in academic discourse engenders an epistemological barrier that precludes inclusive access to knowledge dissemination."
- After: "Using big words in academic writing creates a barrier that stops many people from accessing knowledge."

Annotations (2):
- ① "BEFORE — academic jargon"
- ② "AFTER — plain English in seconds"

---

**Screenshot 5: Academic Context (screenshot-5-academic-context.html)**

URL bar: `scholar.google.com` or `arxiv.org/abs/2026.xxxxx`
Website content: Scientific paper abstract with dense terminology.
Floating button visible. Popup showing simplified result.

Content:
- Original: "Recent advancements in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in natural language processing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark evaluations."
- Simplified: "New AI models based on a design called transformers have gotten really good at understanding and working with text, beating previous records on many tests."

Annotations (2):
- ① "Research papers, legal docs, technical manuals — all fair game"
- ② "AI-powered simplification, no copy-pasting required"

**Create `store/screenshots/capture.mjs`:**
Playwright script that renders each HTML file to a 1280x800 PNG.

```js
import { chromium } from 'playwright'
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'
import { dirname, join, basename } from 'path'
import { readdirSync } from 'fs'

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))

const browser = await chromium.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 })

const htmlFiles = readdirSync(__dirname)
  .filter(f => f.startsWith('screenshot-') && f.endsWith('.html'))
  .sort()

for (const file of htmlFiles) {
  const htmlPath = join(__dirname, file)
  const pngPath = join(__dirname, file.replace('.html', '.png'))
  await page.goto(`file://${htmlPath}`)
  // Wait for Google Fonts to load (or timeout after 3s)
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle').catch(() => {})
  await page.screenshot({ path: pngPath, clip: { x: 0, y: 0, width: 1280, height: 800 } })
  console.log(`Captured: ${basename(pngPath)}`)

await browser.close()
console.log('Done — check store/screenshots/ for PNG files')
